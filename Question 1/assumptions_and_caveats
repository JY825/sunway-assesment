Question 1
Please list down your assumptions & caveats of the system that you have developed.

My assumptions of the system that I develop will be:
•	The CCTV camera is assumed to be positioned at a fixed, elevated angle, offering a top-down view to reduce occlusion and simplify vehicle tracking.
•	The system assumes relatively consistent lighting throughout the day, as sudden changes like sun glare or headlights could impact detection accuracy.
•	The roads are expected to have clear markings, such as lanes and pedestrian crossings, to aid in more accurate vehicle tracking.

My caveats for the system that I develop will be:
•	Despite a top-down view, vehicles may still be partially occluded by larger objects like trucks or buses, leading to missed detections or tracking errors.
•	Weather conditions such as rain, fog, or snow can reduce vehicle visibility, affecting the system's accuracy.
•	The system's accuracy in vehicle tracking and counting relies heavily on the video stream's resolution, with low-resolution footage potentially causing inaccuracies, especially for smaller vehicles.
